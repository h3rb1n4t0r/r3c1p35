Inspired by [Vito Iacopelli](https://www.youtube.com/@vitoiacopelli) and [Teichners Pizza Palace](https://www.youtube.com/@Teichners_Pizza_Palace)
## Ingredients
For 3 Pizza's
* 520g Pizza Flour (Type 00)
* Semola
* Fresh Yeast
* Honey
* Salt
* Cold Water

## Poolish (2 hours, thereof 10 mins active)
1. Mix 100g flour, 100ml water, 6g yeast, 2 teaspoons of honey in a tupperbox using a fork
2. Seal and let rest for 1-2 hours at room temperature
3. Put it in to the fridge over night

## Dough
### Base (2.5, thereof with 25 mins active)
1. Take poolish out of the fridge and give it 45 minutes to accomodate to room temperature
2. Put 420g flour, 13g salt and another 3g yeast with the poolish in the mixing bowl of the kitchen machine
3. Mix the dough in the kitchen machine for 10 - 15 minutes while adding **step by step** a total of 230ml water - *this allows the dough to absorb the water*
4. Remove dough from the bowl to the counter and [fold it](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=x9VhxrxLXqaJqqjt&t=265) 20 times while keeping top side on top - *this makes the dough less sticky and adds air into it*
5. Form the dough to a big ball by forming a [funnel-like form](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=1WdL95Xa-JzTvFWj&t=289) with your hands around the bottowm of the dough and twisting it
6. Cover the dough with a bit of olive oil, put the mixing bowl upside down on it and let it rest for an hour

### Pizza balls (30-45 minutes)
1. Remove mixing bowl from dough, slice it into three even parts - *these will be your Pizza balls*
2. Keep top of the parts on top, while folding dough under the part to form a ball - *you can also [flip the ball and fold it upwards](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=geojQPr5197EfTK7&t=361), just make sure to turn it around again before the next step*
3. [Form a cave](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=oZ4Ncbr068rG_Z-m&t=380) with your hands over and around the Pizza ball, pull the ball towards you, lift the ball while rotating it a bit and repeat - *this closes the ball underneath*
4. Repeat for every Pizza ball
5. Cover Pizza balls with oil and put the mixing bowl on them to rest another 1-2 hours
6. Pre-heat your oven to the maximum in Pizza - *for conventional household ovens, use its Pizza (convection + lower Rod) or convection mode*
7. Take a tupper box and fill some semola into it
8. Remove mixing bowl from Pizza balls, put semola on the connections between the balls and separate them from each other
9. Add Pizza ball into semola tupper box, turn it to have both sides covered with Semola
10. Follow [Mr. Teichner's instructions](https://youtu.be/hxMMT9NrGcc?si=JFkn1DhSCmJXnb72&t=539) to form your Pizza ball to a Pizza
11. Put the stuff you like on it
12. Put the Pizza in your oven, check every now and then to find about the sweet spot. 275Â°C is usually ready after 6-8 minutes
13. Enjoy
